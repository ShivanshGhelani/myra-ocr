# GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide will help you push your Text Scanner OCR application to GitHub and prepare it for deployment.

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd s:\Projects\FastAPI\SeperateFolder\Typed_OCR

# Initialize a Git repository
git init
```

### 2. Add Files to Git

```bash
# Add all files (excluding those in .gitignore)
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
# Commit with an initial message
git commit -m "Initial commit of Text Scanner OCR application"
```

### 4. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "text-scanner-ocr")
5. Add a description: "A FastAPI-based OCR application for extracting text from images"
6. Choose visibility (public or private)
7. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have those)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 5. Link Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/text-scanner-ocr.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If your default branch is "master" instead of "main", use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### 6. Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Ensure all files have been successfully pushed

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub, you can:

1. Follow the instructions in `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy the application to Render.com
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
3. Configure branch protection rules if collaborating with others

Congratulations! Your project is now on GitHub and ready for deployment.
